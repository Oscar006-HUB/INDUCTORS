This project demonstrates a simple and effective method for detecting back EMF (electromotive force) using an ESP32 microcontroller. Back EMF is a voltage generated in an electric motor that opposes the current creating the motor's rotation. Detecting this can be useful for various applications, such as determining if a motor is spinning or for basic motor control feedback.
